# TODO

## Styling
 * Everything
   
## Scalability
 * Make the posts render ~ 20 at a time
 * User component should not take in user prop. It should fetch the user in URL.

## Important
 * On profile show posts
 * Redirecting
 * Show recipients in posts in Post component
 * Profile picture object that maps each username to a profile pic so that multiple GETs don't need to be made. Also make a backend method to get JUST the profile picture of a user.
