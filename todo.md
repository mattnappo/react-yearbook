# TODO

## Styling
 * Everything
   
## Scalability
 * Make the posts render ~ 20 at a time (also a backend issue)
 * Feed component: Profile picture object that maps each username to a profile pic so that multiple GETs don't need to be made. Also make a backend method to get JUST the profile picture of a user.

## Other
 * Show posts on user profile (tabs)
 * Safety redirecting
 * Account not yet registered when viewing an unregistered user.
 * Only show activity for seniors
